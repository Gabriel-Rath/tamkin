# Analyze the chemical reaction. These are the arguments:
#  1) a list of reactant partition functions
#     (one for unimolecular, two for bimolecular, ...)
#  2) the transition state partition function
#  3) the starting temperature for the fit
#  4) the final temperature for the fit
# The following are optional arguments:
#  6) temp_step: The interval on the temperature grid in Kelvin, 10 is default
#  5) mol_volume: a function that returns the molecular volume (inverse of the
#     concentration) for a given temperature. If not given, it assumes that
#     this is given: FixedVolume(temp=298.15*K, pressure=1*atm)
#  7) tunneling: a tunneling correction object

# Estimate the error on the kinetic parameters due to level of theory artifacts
# with Monte Carlo sampling. The monte_carlo method takes three optional
# arguments:
#  1) freq_error: the absolute stochastic error on the frequencies (default=1*invcm)
#  2) energy_error: the absolute error on the energy (default=0.0)
#  3) num_iter: the number of monte carlo samples (default=100)
