TAMkin is a post-processing toolkit for normal mode analysis, thermochemistry
and reaction kinetics. It uses a Hessian computation from a standard
computational chemistry program as its input. CHARMM, CP2K, CPMD, GAMESS,
GAUSSIAN, QCHEM and VASP are supported. Multiple methods are implemented to
perform a normal mode analysis (NMA). The frequencies from the NMA can be used
to construct a molecular partition function to derive thermodynamic and kinetic
parameters.
